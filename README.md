# Run-Commands-With-Events-ClarityCDS
1- Use the same procedure to import the script in Clarity CDS
2- In the Configuration window, name the event in (Event Name), select the event from (Event List), then select available commands (batch files) in the directory where the script located from (Available Commands)
3- To test this, create some simple batch files in the same directory of the ruby file script, use this link to find simple examples: https://github.com/happy05dz/Batch-Script-Collection
4- Now run Clarity CDS software, observe the commands invoked with the different events you chose (ex: choosing event (Open Instrument) with command (Date & time.bat) will run this batch file once you click on the instrument image on opening the software)
